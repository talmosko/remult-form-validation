# Remult Form Validation

A sample repo to view the end-to-end validation abilities of [Remult](https://remult.dev)

At the `App.tsx` file, we can easily switch between React Hook Form and Formik.

To run the project, we need to use both scripts:

```bash
# for running the client side (React)
npm run dev 

# for running the server side (Express)
npm run dev-node
```
